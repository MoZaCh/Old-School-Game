Just give your thoughts about the story, not exactly sure on what im writing xD

Character lives a normal life when something tragic happens to their village. 
They are then given the choice to do something about the situation or back down and let their village still scum to
abuse and mistreatment. 

(if the option to back down happens, the game ends with your village in shambles)

you chose to stand up, you couldnt stand it anymore, you tried to search for some meaning to save your village, so you tried to seek
help to help you save your village, you hear rumors that a mage with great powers is able to be found somewhere, you can choose to either
go to this mage to try and convince them to take you under as an apprentice to learn the arts of magic or either choose to look for an alternative
solution. (MAGE ROUTE)


you find a training camp, here they teach combat of the highet calibar.
